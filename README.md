# Advent of Code 2023 - Template

## Usage

Solve the problem using the `solution` function inside `part_1` and `part_2`.

You can run `cargo test` to check if your solution is correct.
Insert the example input inside the `test_.txt` and the expected output inside the `check_solution` function.

The puzzle input for each day should be inserted inside the `puzzle.txt` file.

To generate the answers for each day, run the following command:

```no_rust
cargo run <dayXX>
```

The answers will be stored inside the yaml file `solution.yaml` on the root.

Add new days inside the `src` folder, making the necessary changes.
